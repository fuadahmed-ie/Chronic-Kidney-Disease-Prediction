# Project Name: Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict whether a person has Chronic Kidney Disease or not based on 24 parameters.

## Notebook Summary

- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Comprehensive data manipulation and analysis have been performed to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Data Visualization**: The dataset has been visualized using various plots to understand the distribution and relationships of features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset has been preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Model Training**: Multiple machine learning models have been trained, including:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - Stochastic Gradient Boosting
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models has been evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
